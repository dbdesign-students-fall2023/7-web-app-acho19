# Flask-MongoDB Web App
## Alice's Resume 
Nowadays, the job market is terrible. I am actually graduating this semester and wow it has not been easy finding a job. However, I decided to put matters into my own hands and create a website that will help me with finding jobs while showing off my cool programming skills. All jokes aside, I believe that there is a potential opportunity to actually create a resume with flask and pymongo. 

Having said that, I wanted to keep my app short and simple because recruiters want your resume to be short and simple. In the front page, I created a simple password page that will only show my resume to the people I have given my password to. The front page also gives a little description about me that will possibly entice recruiters to read more about me. 

Currently, on my resume, I have put in fake companies and experiences alongisde dates. I decided to do that because the password page is definitely not secure as the password is hardcoded into the script.
