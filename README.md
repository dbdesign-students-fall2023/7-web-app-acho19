# Flask-MongoDB Web App
## Alice's Resume 
Nowadays, the job market is terrible. I am actually graduating this semester and wow it has not been easy finding a job. However, I decided to put matters into my own hands and create a website that will help me with finding jobs while showing off my cool programming skills. All jokes aside, I believe that there is a potential opportunity to actually create a resume with flask and pymongo. 

Having said that, I wanted to keep my app short and simple because recruiters want your resume to be short and simple. In the front page, I created a simple password page that will only show my resume to the people I have given my password to. The front page also gives a little description about me that will possibly entice recruiters to read more about me. Currently, on my resume, I have put in fake companies and experiences alongisde dates. I decided to do that because the password page is definitely not secure as the password is hardcoded into the script.

As we go into the resume, I decided to order my experiences not by when it was created but by the end date. For example, we can see that Company B was created after Company A was created but it is listed below because Company B's end date is before Company A's. I have also decided to keep all the features in this one page because it is easier to manage and determine what more to put on my resume with the creation of it down below.
